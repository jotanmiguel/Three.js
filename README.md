## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The goal with this project is to understand how Three.js work, because I'm working on a project that uses this technology. 
Also, I wanted to improve my 3D skills, and this will help a lot on how the "3D world" works.
In the end, I want to have a fully working 3D animation, based on the video, with some twists, and a finished project.
